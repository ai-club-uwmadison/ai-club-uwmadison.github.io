      <h1>Raison d'Ãªtre</h1>
    		<p>
          Finding a purpose in life is a difficult spiritual task. Every person might find their own goals and reasons to live.
          For a CS/Quantitative major, perhaps an acceptable purpose would be to use superpowers such as programming and analytical skills to solve important problems faced by society.
          However, solving important problems are often difficult and cannot be done alone. Hence, the best way to solve meaningful problems is to organize people into a group.
          This prescription for solving problems is laid out by Paul Graham, Y Combinator Founder, in his essay <a href="http://paulgraham.com/before.html">"Before the Startup"</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus follows the purpose of the Artificial Intelligence Club at UW-Madison for its members:
          <p style="text-indent: 80px">
            1. To learn a lot about things that matter
          </p>
          <p style="text-indent: 80px">
            2. To work on problems that are interesting
          </p>
          <p style="text-indent: 80px">
            3. With people you like and respect
          </p>
        </p>

        <p>
          In the past few years, with the recent success of deep learning, and the wide applicabiltiy of this technique, has lead us to believe that a number of important
          problems can and will be solved using Artificial Intelligence. Hence, we have chosen to use AI as the thing to learn about that matters a lot and we want to use
          this incredible superpower to impact the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          If what you've read so far appeals to you, then we want you to join us. We do not expect any specific background in AI,
          however, we do expect great demonstrated quantitative skills, excellent values and a hunger for solving problems.
        </p>
